                        Hello there. My name is Gabriel Alvarado. I was Born on June 8th, 1992 and raised in 
                        Morristown, NJ and moved to charlotte, NC in 2009. I am bilingual 
                        and speak spanish very fluently. My parents are both from Honduras.
                        I consider myself to be a hardworking and intelligent individual 
                        who's just trying to make a career for myself.
                            I currently work as a manager at GreenStar
                            Pallet and Recyling working about 60 hours a week.
                            We're a 3rd party logistics
                            for CHEP. I've been with the company for about 6
                            years now, it's been good to me so far and I
                            appreciate the oppurtunity it's given me. However,
                            it is not something I want to do forever.
                            <br> 
                            I've always been interested in technology and programs
                            and just how they work and how it's created. I
                            thought to myself this bootcamp would be a great
                            way to dive into this new world, and I haven't 
                            been disappointed yet! This class has been challenging
                            so far but it's what I expected when I signed up. They
                            don't call it bootcamp for nothing. I'm confident that
                            when I graduate I'll have the problem solving skills that I need
                            to tackle the industry.
